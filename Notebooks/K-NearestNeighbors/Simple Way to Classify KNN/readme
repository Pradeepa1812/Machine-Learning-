1)select the k value
2)we calculate the distance of the nearest neighbors
3)then check whether the category belongs to category1 or category 2
4)if the category 1 neighbor value is more then the category2 means the query point belongs to category1


How model is ready
-------------------------
We calculate the distance using 
1)Eucledian
2)Manhatten distance
